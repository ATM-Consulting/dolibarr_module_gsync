## Installation

PHP Google People API can be easily installed using Composer. Just run the following command from the root of your project.

```
composer require rapidwebltd/php-google-people-api
```

If you have never used the Composer dependency manager before, head to the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/) for more information on how to get started.

## Setup

To use this package, you need to authenticate with Google via OAuth 2. Thankfully, this is made easy by the PHP Google OAuth 2 Handler package.

You can run its guided setup script with the following command.

```
php vendor/rapidwebltd/php-google-oauth-2-handler/src/setup.php
```

This will guide you through the process of setting up a project, and logging into to the Google account that you wish to manage contacts for.
When asked which scopes you require access to, enter the following.

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly
```

When complete, you will have to code you need to create a `GoogleOAuth2Handler` object for this Google account.

You can then create a `GooglePeople` object, as follows.

```php
$people = new GooglePeople($googleOAuth2Handler);
```
